Arrakis is a strong font family and sophisticated sans serif. Inspired by the sport, it's sturdy uncompromising style is felt through the controlled letterforms and modern touches. A balance of hard lines and smooth curves. Each font in the family can stand on its own, dynamic, and authoritative in its own right.

Arrakis works great in any branding, logos, magazines, films, sports title, news, jersey, music, events. The different weights give you a full range to explore a whole host of applications, while the outlined fonts give a real modern feel to any project.
